%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% 
% This script works like play.pl for the computer player. The
% difference compared with play.pl is that the human player, below
% nicknamed "Stupid", now plays automatically by making random
% moves: It tries, at random, to place a stone at empty positions
% and without any AI. 
%
% This script can be used to carry out automated test-runs of your AI code
% in othello.pl as a complement to manual playing/testing.
%
% NB! The name of each procedure that has been added ends with XYZ to
% lower (eliminate?) the risk of name collisions with procedures
% in othello.pl.
